### **1. Supervised Learning**

* **Definition:**
  A type of machine learning where the model is trained on **labeled data**.
  *Labels here mean data — we tell the model “this is apple, this is mango.”*

* **Example:**
  We give apples and mangoes to our machine learning model, and it will **predict** based on the new image we provide.

### **2. Unsupervised Learning**

* **Definition:**
  A type of machine learning where the model is trained or learns on **unlabeled data**.
  *Here we don’t tell the model what is apple or mango.*

* **Example:**
  We give 100 mixed images of apples and mangoes to the model.

  * The machine will learn and **categorize** the data into **Group 1** and **Group 2**.
  * When we give a new image, it will **predict** whether it belongs to Group 1 or Group 2 based on its learning.

### **3. Reinforcement Learning**

> An area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents take actions in an environment to maximize their rewards.

#### **Main Aspects of Reinforcement Learning**

1. **Environment**
2. **Agent**
3. **Action**
4. **Reward**

---

#### **Example 1: Chess Program**

* **Environment** → The chessboard
* **Agent** → The computer program
* **Action** → The move the agent makes
* **Reward** →

  * **+1** if the agent wins
  * **−1** if it loses
  * **0** for a draw

The program plays many games, makes mistakes, and gets feedback (rewards).
Slowly, it figures out which moves increase its chances of winning and becomes smarter.

👉 Cars, drones, and robotics all use **reinforcement learning**.

#### **Example 2: Training a Dog 🐕**

* 🏡 **Environment** → Your home where the dog moves around
* 🐕 **Agent** → The dog
* 🦴 **Action** → What the dog does (e.g., sit, jump, bark)
* 🍪 **Reward** → A treat if it does the right thing, or nothing if it doesn’t

👉 Over time, the dog learns which actions get treats, so it starts doing those more often.
