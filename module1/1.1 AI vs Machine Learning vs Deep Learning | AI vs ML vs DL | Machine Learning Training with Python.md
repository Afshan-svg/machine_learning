If u see **ven diagram** we can say:

* Outer bound we have **Artificial Intelligence**
* Inside that we have **Machine Learning**
* Inside that we have **Deep Learning**

### **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

> Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines.

* **Example:**

  * Non-intelligent machines: **bikes, watch**
  * Intelligent machines: **self driving cars, chess playing computer**

---

### **Machine Learning (ML)**

> Machine learning is a technique to implement AI that can learn from data by themselves without being explicitly programmed.

* **Example:**
  If we wanna train a machine with numerous images of **Captain America** and **Iron Man**:

  * The machine will train itself to identify the images of Captain America and Iron Man.
  * Now if we give a new image of Captain America or Iron Man, the machine will **predict the image correctly**.
  * Like a **child seeing something and learning**.

### **Deep Learning (DL)**

> Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from the data.

* Even in our brain we have **neurons interconnected** to each other.
* Similarly, we have **artificial neural networks** in deep learning.

#### Different layers present in deep learning:

* **Input layer:** input data is given
* **Hidden layer:** where the processing is done
* **Output layer:** gives the output
