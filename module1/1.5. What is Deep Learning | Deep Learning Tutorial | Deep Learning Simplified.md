### **Deep Learning**

> Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from the data.

We send neuron data which have some mathematical functions to the next layer and the next layer and so on until we reach the output layer.
It is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, particularly the way neurons process and transmit information.

* We can have **n number of hidden layers**, but only **1 input layer** and **1 output layer**.

### **Feature Extraction**

> Main distinction between deep learning and machine learning is feature extraction.

* **Example:**
  In ML, for intelligent cars we need to tell the model that the car will have 4 wheels and 1 steering wheel and 2 mirrors and so on.
  But in deep learning, we don’t need to do that — the model will learn by itself.
  The mathematical functions in the neurons will help the model to learn by itself and are much powerful.
  We can also predict multiple things using deep learning.

* **Used in:** healthcare, Tesla cars, computer vision, face recognition, natural language processing, ChatGPT
