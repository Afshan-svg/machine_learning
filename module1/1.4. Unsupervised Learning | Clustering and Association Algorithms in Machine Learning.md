### **Types of Unsupervised Learning**

---

### **1. Clustering**

> Clustering is an unsupervised task which involves grouping the similar data points together.
> The goal of clustering is to identify the inherent structure in the data and group similar data points into clusters.

* **Example:**
  Suppose we get a project from a telecom company to find relationships of their users and increase revenue.
  We feed the data into our ML model and it will form clusters and group similar users together based on their usage patterns and demographics.
  Then we can target each cluster with specific marketing campaigns and offers to increase revenue.

### **2. Association**

> Association is an unsupervised task which involves finding the relationships between different variables in a dataset.
> The goal of association is to identify patterns and relationships between different variables in the data.
> Find important relationships between data points.

* **Example:**
  Suppose we have bread, milk, fruits, etc., and we find a relationship between these items.
  We find that people who buy bread also buy milk â€” this can be useful.
  Another example: movie recommendations based on what the user has watched previously.
